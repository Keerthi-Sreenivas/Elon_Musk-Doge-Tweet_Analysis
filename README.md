# Elon_Musk-Doge-Tweet_Analysis
The crypto currency Dogecoin’s price has seen great fluctuations in april and may of 2021. Our study tries to observe the trends in twitter sentiments and the significant impact of Elon Musk’s twitter activity on Dogecoin over a series of two events. Two such event’s we analyzed is when, after Elon Musk claimed via Twitter that “SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon” and later called himself “DogeFather” as he announced pub- licly that he would be hosting the Saturday Night Live on 8 May 2021. By doing sentiment analysis using Textblob on relevant tweets before Musk’s tweet , during the period between his tweet and his actual appearance on the show and after the show , we found that Tweet volume , twitter sentiments and Google trends collectively play as predictor variables of price direction. By using these insights, a per- son is able to make better informed purchase and selling decisions related to Dogecoin/ or other crypto currencies when they are being talked about.
